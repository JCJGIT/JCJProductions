  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
	<p>Welcome to the website
<br><br>
	My name is Josh Cording Jones, and I am 19 years old and have been studying at the College of West Anglia for the last 2 years with this being my 3rd. As part of my first year of my Level 3 Games Design I have been tasked by a local offer commission from <abbr title="Special Educational Needs and Disabilities">SEND</abbr>
	to create a game for the targeted group of 10 to 16 years to make a fun engaging game from the genres that the children have agreed as their overall favourite, The game must have some form of educational factor in the gameplay which will have to make the player have some 
	form of strategy. This website will allow people who may be interested in the development of the game to see what route has been taken to make the game and submit questions to whatever they may want to know, this website will be the HQ of all the currant development the game has made, 
	as users will be updated accordingly to what they may need to know.
<br><br>
	My personal interests are sports, fitness, football, digital art, and gaming. The games that I play is Call of Duty, Apex Legends, GTA V and Titanfall, I believe my long history of playing games all factor into my vision for design as they all have to pay a lot of attention to map design, 
	character arc and story and I think this will allow me to make a better game than people that don’t have much interest in games as I have more gameplay knowledge. I think my interest in fitness and sport is something else that allows me to get a good job done as they require a lot of dedication 
	and persistence to accomplish the goal, which I think will allow me to be able to get the job done regardless of what happens.

  <h3 class="w3-center">The Game</h3>
  <p class="w3-center">For the commission I have received from SEND I have to create a game which will be played by kids 10 – 16. The game must be colourful, educational and engaging 
  for the player to feel engaged and interested.
  
  <br><br>
  
  The game that I am making is called Space Flight: Asteroid Escape, the purpose of this game is to make it as far as possible without being destroyed by various dangers including (Asteroids and Enemies). 
  You will encounter a varied environment as you progress through the levels where the asteroid levels vary depending on how far you make it, also you will gain power ups which will help you get an advantage 
  and make it further then you might without, the two power ups you can find is a laser core and shield core, the laser core will allow you to make a new path by destroying asteroids and enemies whilst the shield 
  core will assist in making you immortal to damage for 15 seconds, these power ups can be upgraded by gaining coins as you go which can increase their abilities to make things more easy. 
  
  <br><br>
  
  Below you will find various concept images of what the main menu, upgrades and gameplay screens may look like
