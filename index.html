  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
	<p>Welcome to the website
<br><br>
	My name is Josh Cording Jones; I am 19 years old and have been studying at the College of West Anglia for the last 2 years with this being my 3rd. As part of my first year of my Level 3 Games Design I have been tasked by a local offer commission from SEND to create a game 
	for the targeted group of 10 to 16 years, I have to make a fun engaging game from the genres that the children have agreed as their overall favourite, The game must have some form of educational factor in the gameplay which will have to make the player have some form of strategy. 
	This website will allow people who may be interested in the development of the game to see what route has been taken to make the game. If you go down to our contact section, you can submit questions to whatever you may want to know. This website will be the HQ of all the currant 
	development the game has made, this website will be updated regularly to keep you updated in progression made.
<br><br>
	Q - What is SEND?
<br>
	A – SEND stands for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities, SEND is the category you come under if you have struggles at school which are due to mental disabilities or if you are disabled. Schools are legally required to give you aid to give you extra support to be able to have better education but also to support you for later on in life where you may struggle.

      <p>In my Games Design L3 Course the 3 units that are combining together to count towards the SEND project we have been commissioned in doing is
		<br><br>
		Unit 6: Media Campaigns A2
		<br>
		Unit 12: Games Development A2
		<br>
		Unit 13: Web Development A2
		<br><br>
		U6 and U12 both will act as planning behind the main game, this will allow us to do all the appropriate planning behind each stage of the game including this current website
		which will act as progression towards the games progress

  <h3 class="w3-center">The Game</h3>
  <p class="w3-center">The game I am creating is going to be called Spaceflight: Asteroid Escape, In this game you as the player are going to be controlling a ship and as the title suggests, the 
  core principles of the game is to escape the asteroid fields, This game is going to be a make it as far possible game like Crossy Road and Pac-Man 365 both featuring on the mobile app stores. 
  You as the player have to manoeuvre through asteroid fields to avoid being hit and being destroyed, by doing this you will want to aim to get the highest scores possible. 
<br><br>
	As you venture through the asteroid fields you will encounter power ups and coins, The power ups will allow you to get a timed advantage in the format of taking no damage by protection 
	of a shield or a more powerful laser beam compared to the basic one shot weapon already equipped to the ship. The coins will allow you as the player to be able to upgrade aspects of the game 
	to allow you to go further like for example upgrade the shield power up to last longer or go faster or make the laser become more powerful, essentially your efforts will be rewarded which will 
	then allow you to venture further.
<br><br>
	Of course you cannot have a space game without the involvement of some form of alien lifeform so featuring in my game I intend to have a boss wave to really test your abilities, 
	it would get boring just dodging asteroids constantly so we want to test you skills in which you will have to tackle an alien out for vengeance this will be triggered after you 
	make it a certain distance.
<br><br>
	Below are some basic concept images of what the games UI (User Interface) may look like when it comes to the Main menu, 
	Upgrades screen and Gameplay:</p>
  
  <!-- Responsive Grid. Four columns on tablets, laptops and desktops. Will stack on mobile devices/small screens (100% width) -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-center" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div class="w3-col m3">
    <img src="Images/Main Menu.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Space flight main menu">
  </div>

  <div class="w3-col m3">
    <img src="Images/Upgrades.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Space flight upgrades menu">
  </div>

  <div class="w3-col m3">
    <img src="Images/Space Flight.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Space flight gameplay">
  </div>
</div>


	<p>For the main menu you will be able to change settings to make the game suit you preference more closely, 
	you will also be able to launch a game, exit if you’ve had enough and navigate to the upgrades screen
<br>
	For the Upgrade Screen you will be able to select each area of gameplay that you want to upgrade to be able 
	to make it further, this will display how many coins you have, how many coins you need to be able to purchase 
	certain upgrade tiers and the types of upgrades.
<br>
	For the Gameplay this isn’t an accurate gameplay example but more an over exaggerated version to let you understand 
	clearly what the core purpose the game offers.
	</p>
		<h4> Ships </h4>
	<p>
	Meet your Ships!
<br><br>	
	Below are the 3 tiers of ship the user can use, they all come with pros and cons which will allow the player to have a varied experience and develop a preference, As this is the production 
	stage of the game I haven’t come to a conclusion in whether the ships should represent difficulty level or if they should be earned to have a better experience, But I will come to a conclusion 
	in the next couple of days.
